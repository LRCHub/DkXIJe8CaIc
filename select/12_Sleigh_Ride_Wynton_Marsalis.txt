Just hear
Those sleigh bells
Jingle-ing
Ring ting
Tingle-ing too
Come on
It's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride
Together with you

Outside
The snow is falling
And friends
Are calling you hoo
Come on
It's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride
Together with you

Giddy-yap, giddy-yap
Giddy-yap, let's go
Let's look at the show
We're riding
In a wonderland of snow
Giddy-yap, giddy-yap
Ggiddy-yap, it's grand
Just holding your hand
We're gliding along
With the song
Of a wintry fairy land

Our cheeks are nice
And rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up
Together like two birds
Of a feather would be
Let's take the road
Before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on
It's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride
Together with you

There's a birthday party
At the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending
Of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs
We love to sing
Without a single stop
At the fireplace
While we watch
The chestnuts pop
Pop, pop, pop

Just hear
Those sleigh bells
Jingle-ing
Ring ting
Tingle-ing too
Come on
It's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride
Together with you

There's a happy feeling
Nothing in the world
Can buy
When they pass around
The coffee
And the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly
Be like a picture print
By Currier and Ives
These wonderful things
Are the things
We remember all through
Our lives

Our cheeks are nice
And rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up
Together like two birds
Of a feather would be
Let's take
The road before us
And sing
A chorus or two
Come on
It's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride
Together with you

Just hear
Those sleigh bells
Jingle-ing
Ring ting
Tingle-ing too
Come on
It's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride
Together with you

Outside the snow
Is falling
And friends
Are calling you hoo
Come on
It's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride
Together with you

Come on
It's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride
Together with you

Come on
It's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride
Together with you
