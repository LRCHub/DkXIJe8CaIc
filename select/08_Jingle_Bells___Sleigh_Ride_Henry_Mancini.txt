Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle jingling
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh, hey

Oh jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Have what joy it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh

There's a birthday party at the home of farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace we will watch the chestnuts pop

There's a happy feeling nothing in this world can buy
When they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print by currier and ives
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring ting tingling, too
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling "Yoo hoo!"
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, let's go
Let's look at the show, we're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, it's grand just holding your hand
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairyland

Our chips are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we
We've snuggled close together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
With you
It's lovely weather for a sleigh ride with you
