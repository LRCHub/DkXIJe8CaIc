# The Ronettes – Sleigh Ride

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Just hear those sleigh bells
Jingle-ing Ring ting Tingle-ing too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling "you hoo"
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy-yap, giddy-yap, giddy-yap, let's go
Just look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy-yap, giddy-yap, giddy-yap, it's grand
Just holding your hand
We're gliding along with the song
Of a wintry fairy land

Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Just hear those sleigh bells
Jingle-ing Ring ting Tingle-ing too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling "you hoo"
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Sleigh ride together with you
Sleigh ride together with you
